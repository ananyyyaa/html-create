 <h1><i><u>Sky Story</u></i></h1>
 <hr>
<p><b>We all have read many story books in our life time , but there is an amazing wonder that we have never observed much is that the nature tells us stories , did'nt understand what i said right . Well we all enjoy nature , it makes us feel happy and fresh . There is one thing we have never observed is the sky , the clouds , their shape.</b> </p>

 <p><b>When you observe the sky the shape of clouds sometimes seems like bird , sometimes like an  animal , a devel , a ship , a flower and what not , moving around you it seems like the nature is trying to tell us a story through the clouds . May be a historical story or something magical or a war .</b></p>
